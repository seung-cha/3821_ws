Source Code for COMP3821

# Code
* path_planner.py: generates a path to the published destination. The underlying planning algorithm is to be customised by you.

* path_follower.py: Follows a path as strictly as possible. It has no safety features such as collision detection and avoidance.

# Note
path_planner.py needs to be run before turtlebot3_navigation. This is because path_planner.py requires map data and turtlebot3_navigation only publishes map once on the start.
